It is not an exact replica of any particular train car, in fact I made a lot of simplifications and took some artistic license. It most closely resembles a yamanote line train, mainly due to the green color scheme, which is the line I rode most frequently when I visited Japan. (and yes I know the yamanote line is not technically the tokyo subway but I wanted to give this work a simple title) The most obvious change I made was to make the train autonomous, there is no section for a driver at the front or back, this was partly because it was simpler to model, since finding references images for those parts is difficult, and because where I live all of the trains are automated like this and I think it is cool to be able to see out the front of the train when you are riding it. Maybe one day trains in Japan will all be automated too, so think of this as a concept of the future.The images in the background are based on a photo I took while I was in Japan, and all textures and meshed used where created by me. Feel free to use this however you like, I don't require attribution but if you use it and want to mention where you got it that would be cool. I also appreciate all of the comments I get and if you have any advice that can help me improve, since I still consider myself a beginner, that would be great!</blockquote><hr /><h3>Help us moderate this file</h3><p>Blend Swap is a place to share and get awesome 3D work, if you think this blend falls into one of the following issues please file a report from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/92263">http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/92263</a> by clicking on the <strong>Manage</strong> panel to the left of the blend and then on <strong>Report/Flag</strong>:</p><ul><li>The blend author didn't make this blend and posted it as their own.</li><li>The blend author is violating a Creative Commons License or copyright.</li><li>The blend is incomplete, work in progress, or has missing textures.</li><li>The blend contains simulation cache files and other unneeded media.</li><li>The preview image has nothing to do with the blend's contents.</li></ul><p>Your help allows the site to stay clear of broken and stolen work.</p><hr /><h4>Notes:</h4><ul><li>Do NOT report this blend if you dont' know how to use a feature on Blender, instead use the <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/questions">questions section</a> of the site.</li></ul>    </article>    <footer>        Original file hosted by <a href="https://www.blendswap.com">Blend Swap, LLC</a>.    </footer></body></html>
